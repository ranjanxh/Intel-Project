# Image Sharpening using Knowledge Distillation

# Real-Time Image Sharpening for Video Conferencing

This project aims to enhance blurry video streams in real-time during video conferencing, using a lightweight convolutional neural network trained via knowledge distillation. The goal is to deliver clearer video output (1080p at 30+ FPS) even on low-bandwidth connections and standard hardware.

## 🔍 Overview

- 📹 Improves clarity of video frames in real-time
- 🧠 Uses a teacher-student model for knowledge distillation
- ⚙️ Focus on efficiency (small model size, fast inference)
- 🎯 Optimized for video conferencing scenarios (faces, text, screens)
